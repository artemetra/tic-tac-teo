# tic-tac-Teo
A variation of the tic-tac-toe game implemented with basic old school JavaScript.

The game is equivalent to tic-tac-toe with a small twist: each player is only allowed 3 Xs/Os in total, which can be moved during the game, using the drag-and-drop API. Thus, it becomes a game that requires constant attention from both players, without a possibility of a draw.

## TODO
- Host this
- Make it look nicer
- Language selection
- Generalize to an N by N grid?
